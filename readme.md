# Photo Organizer

DEPRECATED for [Media Organizer](https://github.com/andrewgremlich/media_organizer).

Need an organizer for your media content on the computer? Run this!

## Features

- Organize photos and videos in a folder structure based off creation dates.

  - Photos organized based off of EXIF creation dates.
  - Video organized based off of FFMPEG creation dates.
  - User provides target folder of unorganized images. Will move photos to a default `photos` directory in the directory where the binary was ran. The outputed folders will be the respective creation dates on the media.

- Allow configurable destination folder.

  - Use the `--dest` flag.

## Dependencies

- C++ build tools (or equivalent like build-essentials) (for ffmpeg-next package)
- FFMPEG

## CLI usage

To quickly organize photos in the target folder, run the following command to output them into the default destination directory.

```bash
photo_organizer --target test-media
```

To add a destination folder for all the organized photos, add the `--dest <DEST_FOLDER>` flag to the end.

While developing with cargo, forward the flags.

```bash
cargo run -- --target test-photos
```

Supports organizing JPG (jpeg, jpg, JPEG), HEIC (heic), and PNG (png) image files and their variants.

## Lib usage

```rust
// Take an image path and return the exif date of the image
pub fn read_photo_creation_date(path_str: &str) -> String

// Take a video path and return the FFMPEG creatioon date.
pub fn read_video_creation_date(path_str: &str) -> String

// Sort all the supported media files in a directory.
// Note: will default folder "photos"
pub fn sorter(dir_str: &str)
```
